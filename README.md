# Description

I needed to make a random password generator for: special charcters, uppercase,lowercase, and between 8 and 128 charcters. The purpose of this is to allow the user to generate a password with certain criteria listed. Let's take it from the top, I am met with certain criteria on a window pop up and need to answer so the function at the end can generate a password. Once I answer all of these, I'm given a new password on the box or alert. This is done by creating an array with all of the variables for special characters, uppercase, lowercase, etc to make an if else statement so the user can click on the criteria.

## User Story
